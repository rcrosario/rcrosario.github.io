            <p id="p">Prostitution has been a big problem since the<br>olden times. A lot of stigma has been<br>incorporated with the sex workers of sort.<br>Prostitutes where even beaten to death back in<br>the Christian times since they do not value their<br>chastity. After all these stigmas, sex workers<br>shall still be respected as a human being even if<br>what they are doing is morally wrong in your<br>own principle. </p>

        <p id="intro" class="float-start" class="container-md">This website will serve as a chance for me to voice<br>out concerns regarding the sexual exploitation of<br>women and children. Aside from the sexual<br>exploitations, this will also hint signs of human<br>trafficking, pedophilia, toxic male culture, and male<br>supremacy. There are a lot of daily reports about<br>women being raped. There are a lot of officials that<br>does not understand that rape is a crime. They<br>simply just sweep it off their shoulders by saying<br>that it's the woman's fault for not dressing properly.</p>
